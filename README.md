# docker-engine-api

Implements the complete API as of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/.

See the doc and example folders for documentation.

This lib was part of a POC/Demo and was coded while reading along the docker documentation.
The lib has been extracted since it otherwise would have been thrown away due to not being able to use Perl for the final project.

Hopefully it can serve as a starting point for someone dedicated to creating a great Perl binding for Docker.
